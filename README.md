# aztail - cli to retrieve Azure logs

aztail supports App Insights and Log Analytics. Its purpose is to extract logs and to allow tailing logs, with an eye to assisting development and operation of Azure Functions. It is inspired by [awslogs](https://github.com/jorgebastida/awslogs).

**Current status**: aztail is early-phase software: it works, but is feature poor.

## Install

aztail is a single binary and can be downloaded from the repository [release page](https://github.com/bittrance/aztail/releases). aztail currently supports MacOS X, Linux and Windows x86-64.

## Authentication

aztail does not itself handle authentication, but expect you to have used e.g. `az login` and `az account set` to provide it with a session.

## Usage
