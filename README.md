# aztail - cli to retrieve Azure logs

aztail is an opinionated tool to retrieve logs from Azure App Insights and Azure Monitor Logs (also known as Log Analytics). These services are exposed as databases, but when debugging, you typically want to retrieve a the logs as a stream. aztail retrieves records from these databases and presents them as a log stream, picking fields that are likely to be relevant for each particular service. It also allows you to "tail" a log stream.

Currently supported Azure services:

- Azure Functions
- Azure API Management

Several more services are in the works: see the [sources](./examples/README.md) page for details on how filters are applied and what data is retrieved.

## Install

aztail is a single binary and can be downloaded from the repository [release page](https://github.com/bittrance/aztail/releases). aztail currently supports MacOS X, Linux and Windows x86-64. aztail depends on [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) as it does not itself handle authentication, but expect you to have used `az login` and `az account set` to provide it with a session.

## Usage

```
Query tables in a App Insights or Log Analytics workspace and presents the result as a human-
readable log stream. When executed with only an App ID or Workspace ID, aztail retrieves logs from
all known services. If one or more filter arguments are used, only logs matching those filters will
be retrieved. Multiple filters can be used and will retrieve the union of matching data
